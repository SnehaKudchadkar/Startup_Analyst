# 🚀 AI-Powered Startup Analyst



## This project uses AI to analyze startup data and deliver a comprehensive founder- or investor-level analysis. For each startup, the app provides:

### Executive Summary – A high-level overview of the startup

### Problem Statement – What pain point the startup is addressing

### Solution Offered – The innovation or service being provided

### Market Analysis – Market size, trends, and potential

### Business Model – How the startup plans to generate revenue

### Competitive Landscape – Key competitors and differentiation

### SWOT Analysis – Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

### Team Assessment – Evaluation of founders and leadership

### Financial Health – Funding status, revenue estimates, and burn rate (if available)

### Risks and Challenges – Potential barriers or red flags

### Investor Recommendation – A final suggestion on whether the startup seems viable for investment




## 🛠️ Tech / Tool - Purpose
### Streamlit - For building the interactive web UI.
### Pandas - To handle and process uploaded CSV data.
### OpenRouter (or OpenAI) - For AI-powered startup analysis via GPT.
### Python - Core programming language.
### requests (Optional) - For future API integration (Crunchbase, etc.).
### Crunchbase API (Planned) - To enrich startup details (founders, funding, etc.).
### Tracxn API (Planned) - For deeper insights on Indian and global startups.



## How it works
You can choose to:
- **Enter data manually** (Startup Name, Description, Founders, Funding, Website, Category)
- **Upload a CSV file** with multiple startups



## 🛠 Future Enhancements (Planned)
This project is designed to be extensible. In the future, I plan to:



### Automatic Startup Enrichment
Use APIs to auto-fill missing details (like Founders, Funding, Website, Category):


### Crunchbase API (Recommended)
- Public API available with structured startup data
- Enables auto-enrichment for well-known startups
- Docs: https://data.crunchbase.com/docs


### Tracxn API (Enterprise-grade)
- Rich database of Indian & global startups
- Enterprise access required
- Website: https://tracxn.com
